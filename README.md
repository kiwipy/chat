# Simple terminal LAN or local chat
- Run setup.sh to create a "chatroom".
- Share the directory via NFS for LAN use.
- Color coded nicks.
- Run toolbox-chat, create a nickname and enjoy!

## Usage
Just press the following key

- w - to start typing a message
- l - to list all users (online users show up in green)
- c - clear your messages
- r - to resend message if wrong nickname was entered

All messages are sent to every user unless the message starts with @username<br>

## Limitations
